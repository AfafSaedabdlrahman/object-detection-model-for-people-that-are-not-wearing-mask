# object-detection-model-for-people-that-are-not-wearing-mask
* Create an ai object detection model for people that are not wearing masks.
* Model: I used deep learning algorithm called Yolo and Opencv. Yolo, which stands for You Only Look Once, is a deep learning algorithm that utilises a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect objects.
*  YOLOv5 is improved on the basis of YOLOv4, and its running speed is greatly improved, with the fastest speed reaching 140 frames per second. Meanwhile, the size of YOLOv5 is small, and the weight file is nearly 90% smaller than that of YOLOv4, which enables YOLOv5 to be deployed to embedded devices. Compared with YOLOv4, YOLOv5 has a higher accuracy rate and better ability to recognize small objects.‚Äù


***Note:**
* I tried also  YOLOv8 which is the latest version but  the run and  the deploy in progress .so  Ican't send it.
